# Features we've added to RedPotion that don't modify an existing gem

## UIColor

UIColor has a `with` method.  Allowing you to build a color from an existing color easily

```ruby
# for example that time you want your existing color, but with a slight change
color.my_custom_color.with(a: 0.5)
```
