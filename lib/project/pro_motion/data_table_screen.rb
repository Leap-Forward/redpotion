  #TODO ? - set_attributes is called twice - seems like this is in PM core
  # this is because we call setup when we build the cell and setup when its
  # about to display - this is because PM wants styling to fire in each case -
  # and properties was where the styling is done in PM
  #
  # if we are going to wire an event when a value is set on a cell, this could
  # be problematic, especially likely since cells are reused, etc
  # see my new cell for example, where I have to remove and then add events
  # because of the double call
